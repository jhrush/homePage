# Just a basic homepage and newtab configuration for Firefox!

In autoconfig.cfg make sure to change line:

>var newTabURL = "file:///home/jake/Projects/homePage/hp.html";

to whatever directory you place hp.html.

autoconfig.cfg goes in:	/usr/lib/firefox/

autoconfig.js goes in:	/usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref

Then simply setting newtab and homepage to defaults in Firefox's Options menu!
