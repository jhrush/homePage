# Just a basic homepage and newtab configuration for Firefox!

In autoconfig.cfg make sure to change line:

>var newTabURL = "file:///home/jake/Projects/homePage/hp.html";

to whatever directory you place hp.html.

autoconfig.cfg goes in:	/usr/lib/firefox/

autoconfig.js goes in:	/usr/lib/firefox/defaults/pref

Then simply set newtab to default and homepage to what you set your newTabURL to:

>file:///home/jake/Projects/homePage/hp.html

You can see an example of this homepage at:
